# README: Mini Manuscript on "Understanding How Money, Culture, and Education Shape Europe"

## Project Information
- **Project Title:** Understanding How Money, Culture, and Education Shape Europe
- **Author:** Caleb Okwesie Arthur
- **Course:** MATH221: Statistics with Probability
- **Instructor:** Dr Eric Ocran

## Overview
This research investigates how socioeconomic and cultural factors, specifically religion, education, income levels, and crime rates, shape European society. The manuscript employs statistical tools, including chi-square tests, to explore relationships between these variables using data from the European Social Survey (ESS). The key questions examined are:

1. Are religious people more educated than non-religious people?
2. Is there a correlation between income levels and crime rates in Europe?

## Structure
1. **Introduction & Background**
   - Discusses the historical influence of religion on education in Europe, particularly during the Middle Ages.
   - Investigates the shift towards secular education and the current relationship between religion, education, income levels, and crime rates.
   - Emphasizes the importance of studying these relationships for public policy and societal well-being.

2. **Materials & Methods**
   - **Dataset:** European Social Survey (ESS)
   - **Variables:**
     - Income levels (low, medium, high)
     - Crime rate (victim of burglary/assault in the last five years)
     - Religion (belonging or not belonging to a particular religion)
     - Education level (7 groups from no education to the highest educational level)
   - **Analysis:** Chi-square tests of independence were used to explore relationships between the variables.

3. **Analysis & Results**
   - **Univariate Analysis:** Descriptive statistics for variables such as crime rate, income levels, religious affiliation, and education levels.
   - **Bivariate Analysis:**
     - Relationship between income levels and crime rate: A chi-square test revealed a significant relationship (p-value = 8.88e-10).
     - Relationship between religious affiliation and education level: A chi-square test also showed a significant relationship (p-value < 2.2e-16).

4. **Discussion, Conclusion, & Recommendations**
   - Confirms a significant association between income levels and crime rates, as well as between religious affiliation and education level.
   - Highlights the relevance of these findings for addressing income inequality and improving education policies in Europe.
   - Suggests further research to investigate the underlying mechanisms of these associations.

## Key Findings
1. **Crime Rate & Income Levels:** A significant relationship was found, indicating that crime rate may vary across different income levels.
2. **Religion & Education Level:** Religious individuals tend to have slightly higher levels of education compared to non-religious individuals, though the gap is smaller in modern times.

## Tools & Techniques
- **Chi-Square Test:** This statistical test was employed to determine the independence of categorical variables like income levels, crime rates, religion, and education.
- **ESS Dataset:** A well-established cross-national survey was used to gather data on attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors across Europe.

## Conclusion
The manuscript provides insights into how money, culture, and education interact in European societies, with significant policy implications for addressing income inequality and promoting educational development.

## Limitations
The study acknowledges potential confounding variables and limitations in data analysis methods, encouraging further research to expand understanding.

## Future Directions
- **Mechanisms of Associations:** Further exploration of the causes behind the identified relationships.
- **Additional Variables:** Incorporating more variables to enrich the understanding of socioeconomic and cultural factors in Europe.
